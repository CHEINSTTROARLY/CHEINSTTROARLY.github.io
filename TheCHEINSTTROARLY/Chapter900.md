A Thorough Description of Grass
Grasses are a special thing.
To fully appreciate Grass, we must know it's beginnings.

On the History of Grass
Once, in an age not unlike our own, grasses had not yet come into existence.
"What!?" you might ask.

"There wasn't even sneaky grass? or Spooky Grass??"
No I'm afraid not. There wasn't even the almighty TRickySOME Grass.
This world was a sad world. Grasses are required for some forms of life to exist.
-1 knew this. But did not make grass just yet. He was waiting for a certain prophesy to be fulfilled.

Yes. The Grass Prophesy.
In the long beginning ages, such prophesies as these were tumbling about.
But that is not important right now.

According to The Book of SHTTRgnarKLP, it reads:
 away, lost in this despicable land.
 a young boyo, of the name of Laank
 was off on a descriptive journey,,
 even a perilous one. He was off on
 his way seeking the great temples.
 
 on his way he met many a foe.. but
 no foe was too strong, because the
 power of MIGIIER was with him that
 day. He strove to this temple, and
 nobody could stop him. Not even -1

 But this was his downfall. There's
 no escuse for even usurping just a
 little to the great and almighties
 to be sure. But powers of MIGIIER.
 They were strong that day. So huge
 that even -1 could not percieve it

 He scoured the land all that day,,
 and then he arrived at the temple.
 He was searching for something....
end

This is all the excerpt we have from the book of SHTTRgnarKLP.
The rest is destroyed and forgotten from time.
We do not know what the power of MIGIIER is. Only the almighties know.
But we do know what was found in the temple that day.

Legend says that the first blade of grass was found that day.
It was guarded terribly, for The Ancients did not want it found just yet.
But one so Willing, one so Stubborn must find it, and plant it for the universes.
This was the prophecy, and it was fulfilled.
Once gained, the first blade of grass was planted in the center of that world.
Grass then became very popular and vibrant, and exhuberated the whole realm.

This single blade of grass is the ancestor of all grasses known today.
Even the large ORTIGORIAN grass whose blades grow miles high.

Why was the blade of grass at that temple, when it was supposed not to have existed?
Alas, old legends have many loopholes such as these //
But it is also said that one of The Immortals placed it there for this purpose.
It will not be fully understood until the End of the Ages.

We even have impeccable compositions dedicated to grass
The most famous being:
 Oh the luscious grass
 pardon all my trespasses 
 Sweetly green you grow
What beautiful imagery.

On the Descriptions of Grass
There are hundreds, maybe even thousands of grasses.
We will attribute this section only to the most well know of grasses.
We will also list of the most powerful grasses, in their respecitve greatness.

The Greenest of Grasses
 Comandrilacorn grass is by far the greenest of grasses.
 Every couple decades, a universal vote is taken place to determine this.
 Comandrilacorn grass has been voted the greenest of grasses 1074 times in history.
 Before Comandrilacorn grass came into existence, there were two grasses close in competition:
 The LAM-ddb Grass and the elelelel grass. These grasses were both equally green, and traded winning spots over and over again.
 The competition was once so dense and dedicated, that entire wars took place because one side lost.
 However, when Comandrilacorn grass was finally discovered, it was plainly seen that no grass could be greener.

The Tallest of Grasses
 ORTIGORIAN grass, in some places, grow miles high.
 The largest of these grasses was measured to be over 57 miles.
 ORTIGORIAN grass is said to have come about in the 3rd age, when expirimental magic was accidentally placed on some TRickySOME Grass.
 How likely this is, we cannot be too sure.
 ORTIGORIAN only lives in Systems of Prefix Type A++ and A#. This is because they need certain atmospheric requirements.
 There is one ORTIGORIAN grass that lives in an A♭ system, but our fact checkers have not completely checked it just yet.
 ORTIGORIAN grass grows from a very tiny seedling. They live to be tens of thousands of years old, usually surpassing the Age they sprouted in.
 Some grass are so large, that when they become unbalanced and fall over, entire plantes or systems can be destoryed.
 This has happened only twice in the history of time, and unlikely to happen again.

The Most Potent of Grasses
 Hhhhhhhh grass is extremely potent.
 If one traverses within a full 100 miles of it, your luck meter will fail.
 It is said that Hhhhhhhh grass is so deadly it can liquify blocks of stone.
 Hhhhhhhh grass is also quite small, about the size of your finger.
 Hhhhhhhh grass is commonly said to have come about in the 6th age, but that is not so.
 Hhhhhhhh grass has been around even soon after the first grass was planted.
 Hhhhhhhh grass has now been exterminated, so universal travel is again at peace.
 Every once in a while, certain groups claim to have rediscovered Hhhhhhhh grass, and will weaponize it.
 But it has always been found out that they were merely bluffing.

(Ha, you thought this was about grass did you?)
(You are completely and utterly mistaKEN)
(You have been so bold as to read this much through)
(But now your real reward is here from all your effort)

The One is HERE. True Prophecies
"OOR pett sipp –––– LOgg fatal LOGS,,,, miirors gr-s"

This is one of the last prophecies, and has not been fulfilled yet.
No one is sure what it means, or even if it really is a prophecy.
Perhaps it will come to pass in this age, or one to come.
But it is certain, and disputed by no one, that this prophecy is the last one related to grasses.
