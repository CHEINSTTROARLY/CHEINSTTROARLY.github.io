History of The First Age

__________________________________________________________________

Commonly known facts about The First Age
 - The First Age began in the beginning of all. It really was the first age. No lies. Regarding the Beginning of the First Age Before the beginning there is no accurate account, only hints. Hints have been carefully deduced into nudges, but these are described separately.
 - The First Age lasted 8192 years, making it a Long Age. There is a little bit of ambiguity here, because of the Years of Silence. It is unknown whether Time Stopped, because all history seems to have been lost during this period, and picks up again afterwards.
 - The First Age had many prophecies. There were 16 prophecies created and fulfilled in the first age. There were also 8 other meta prophecies that outlived their own age. 2 of them came to pass in the 8th age, another 2 came to pass in the 77th age. The other 4 have not come to pass, and likely will not until the End of the Ages.
 - The Immortals slept in immortal slumber only 32 years into The First Age. They did not awaken until The First Age was coming to it's close. No one truly knows the reason for this. There have been rumors and legends, but mostly they have been found to be false.
 - The FISHOFGOLD system is still with us today, making it the oldest system.
 - When we say certain systems are inhabited, we will only give you the name of the intelligent species who live there.

Systems in the First Age
The First Age had around 40 systems. Only a few of them were ever inhabited. Only 9 of them passed into the Second Age.
We have alphabetized them in out own language and provided short summaries of each system. Unfortunately, we regret some Systems are not as well known, and we are unable to glean any infromation from them. We are completely certain of their existence, however, because they were recorded by The Mortals when they travelled to every system.

 • System 0000
   - Also known as the land of Zed. A mysterious place, most species never travel to this land, unless they wish to inquire of Zed. Which is not quite often, because Zed is quite scary. In any case, this system passed into the Second Age because of the phrase, "Zed knows all. Zed knows all."
