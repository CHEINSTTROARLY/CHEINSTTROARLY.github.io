Part 1 Events in the first age important to the Great Evil

Creation of the 13th and 14th Sacred Peoples of Petrichor

An err into the first age of the Book, 10 years after the creation of the 12th, Petrichor created the 13th and greatest of the 14 Sacred Peoples. As with the others, there were 14 originally, and the original ones were nearly immortal. However, unlike the others, the Thirteenth were truly immortal, unless one should be destroyed in battle, which while difficult originally would become far more difficult as time went on, until in the Fourth Age of the book of CHEINSTTROARLY, when the 13th was destroyed, leaving one alone. Also unlike the others, they were unable to reproduce. However, they are the only beings save the First to have entered the main structure of a Sacred Temple of Petrichor and survived, for that is where they were created, one for each. These peoples the First Being also made much closer to his full form, albeit much smaller, though still much larger than any others. To these the First Being granted many powers, the likes of which had never been given before and never would later. These beings are the phoenixes, of which now only one remains. Though not as many perished in the Great Evil as the losses of the 14th Sacred Peoples, the species as a whole was harmed far more.

Two er after that, the 14th Sacred Peoples were created. Unlike the others, these were not created only by Petrichor, but rather mostly by -1, with the assistance of Petrichor. Therefore the original fourteen were far more mortal than the original members of all the other Thirteen Mortal Peoples of Petrichor. Even if the Great Evil had not removed their immortality, by the fifth age none would remain that remember the beginning of humans in Nindy’s Place.

Part 2 Early life and beginning of evil of the Second Human, referred to as Yugdab in the book of CHEINSTTROARLY

Although not known as Yugdab (which is “Bad guy” spelled backwards) until after the Great Evil, his name, like all the original members of all the 14 Sacred Peoples except for the greatest of the phoenixes, receives the same protection as the main structure of one of the 14 Sacred Temples of Petrichor, and after the Great Evil was only uttered once without punishment from the power of Petrichor. While the protection will stop in the Sixth age of the book of CHEINSTTRAORLY, after the Great Massacre, by then only one besides the First Beings themselves will know his true name.
Yugdab was the second human to be created, and Petrichor had more hand in the creation of Yugdab than -1, the only human where that is the case. Therefore, several er after the humans left Nindy’s Place, he encountered a phoenix. This phoenix was one of the three created on Earth, which in pre-human prophecies in the book of CHEINSTTROARLY is called the Land of Three Temples, for there are three Sacred Temples of Petrichor there, among them the greatest of the Fourteen. From the phoenix Yugdab learned much that no human before nor after would ever learn, for the phoenixes possess much knowledge that others lack. For three err, Yugdab lived in peace. Soon, the first human died of a sickness that killed her and all of her followers. Seeing that the 14 original humans could die, something which Yugdab had previously thought something only for others, Yugdab became nervous. He then created massive armies, for his kingdom which he shared with the third human was one of the most vast. In secret, escaping the knowledge of all but the First Beings, who paid no attention to his actions, though they should have, he created armor that was almost impenetrable, and several terrible swords, in the style of those most often used by the phoenixes when they fought in a form which required them. It is from a phoenix where he learned the art of metalworking, and because of a phoenix he was able to create these things. However, the phoenix who taught him these things did not know what would happen, nor indeed what it would lead to.

Part 3 the Great Evil

Of his most terrible weapons, all but one were given to his sons who had not yet grown so old that they had grown sick and died, or who were not so old they couldn’t fight. At this time there were 4. However, the most terrible of his creations Yugdab kept for himself, hiding it even from the third human, who had lived with him since the time of Nindy’s Place. However, one day Yugdab stood in the hardest to reach part of his fortress, one er after he began preparing for war, watching his soldiers training in the fields, when the third human approached him, wondering why he had been preparing for war for so long. He pointed out that as the original humans lose their kingdoms and mortal humans gain some of their own, wars between humans had started. And though he said, and maybe even thought, that he only wanted to defend himself, he truly wanted to gain more land than his small kingdom, which in recent years had lost many humans to others with mortal rulers. One such ruler grew suspicious of these preparations, and decided to attack before Yugdab could attack him. Therefore he started his own secret preparations, and in two years attacked. His soldiers got into the main fortress and even almost to the king’s room, and as Yugdab quickly hid his most beautiful creations, among them a spoon made by a phoenix, his enemies got into the next room over, where his eldest two sons still alive and the third human were hiding. Hearing this, he grabbed his weapons and rushed in there, to find all three dead. The enemy soldiers tried to defeat him to, but did not expect him to be so good at fighting, or indeed to use his powers given to him by the First Beings in the time of Nindy’s Place.
Still, he and his forces lost the battle, and he was forced into a distant village, and lived there for an er. One day he came across a young man with an almost worthless coin, and knew how to preserve his life even longer. Using his powers, he stole the coin and went to Nindy’s Place. There he climbed the steps of the greatest of the Fourteen Sacred Temples of Petrichor. He jumped from the edge of the stairs to the elevated platform accessible only from the air or the main structure, which he could not enter. There he placed the coin, and he called for his brother, who was the fourteenth and greatest human. His brother came, and Yugdab forced him to push the coin halfway into the main structure. Through his brother he forced the power which Petrichor had put into the Sacred Temple to bind him to the coin, so that all his powers are inside of it, and as long as the coin remains he must also live. Doing this caused all but one of the names of the original members of the 14 Sacred Peoples, and the original name of Nindy’s Place to receive the same protections as the main structure of the Sacred Temple.
