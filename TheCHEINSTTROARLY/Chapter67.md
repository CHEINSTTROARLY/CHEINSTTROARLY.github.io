iii - The Lenny Bat Language
The most little known language of them all is: iii
Lenny Bats only communicate in iii under advanced or sidewise circunstances.
iii is a language only The Immortal creatures can speak.

Uncovered Terms of iii, specifically used by Lenny Bats
 iiiiiiii::: - A magical word only spent in deducing the natural skills of prey
 iii.,,&&$iiiiII II, I!! - A capital phrase commonly used for breakfast or brunch
 iiiii - A word denoting the importance of capturing prey
 IIIııÌÍⁱIͥuu ii u  uu ii    I - A song only sung during the upgrading of a Lenny Bat.
 iiiIIhhhhhhI   IIII - Night lifting.
These five terms sum up the majority of iii spoken by Lenny Bats.
Some of these ideas may not transpose into simplistic terms. But no worries.
There are a few other terms, but these have been lost in time and are only known to the Lenny Bats.

In ancient times, specifically before the 10th age, Lenny Bats also spoke the Language of upupu.
But ever since the 10th age, Lenny Bats have lost their special skill of IMpromptU3.
A necessity of being able to comprehend the language of upupu.
In this current age, only 3 species (and 4 meta species) can currently comprehend the language of upupu.
It is impossible to transpose the ideas and terms used in upupu. It's the first of 5 incomprehensible languages.

Why did the Lenny Bats lose their special skill of IMpromptU3?
They forgot to honor the almighty -1 when the planets aligned//.
A simple mistake, but detrimental when -1 discovers this.
-1 removed their special skill of IMpromptU3 because of this and many more reasons.


The History of the Lenny Bat
Lenny Bats have not always been with us. They were created near the end of the 3rd age by the supreme Petrichor.
During this capable time, Lenny Bats grew in popularity.
They soon took advatage of many systems, even some powerful systems.
A massive war was waged between the Lenny Bats and the ALLknowings ETHEREAL.
During this timeframe, the planets aligned, and they forgot to honor the almighty -1.
-1 foreknew this and percieved it, and took away their ability of IMpromptU3.
Without their IMpromptU3, the Lenny Bats lost of battle with the ALLknowings ETHEREAL.
Some historians say -1 was on the side of the ALLknowings ETHEREAL.
Lenny Bats have now secluded themselves only in the System of LLL--nnCCiiiiii, and only then are rare on a few planets.
Seeing a Lenny Bat these days are rare indeed, and capturing one will gain one 33000 XP. And maybe an aknwoledgement by º¹⁶⁶.
