Speaking in CODE
Several Users have discovered how to program.

Define Programming Language
 • A special language that only computers can understand
 • These languages must be discovered, not invented

There are a few languages currently popular
 • elBasic
    The first programming language ever discovered
    It is not as basic as you might think.
    All commands must be written with 'el' in front of them.

 • vovwow
    The second programming language ever discovered
    vovwow is a extremely powerful, even supporting things bespeaking with -1

 • quicc-and-go
    Currently the most commonly used programming language.
    Speaking with Computers has never been easier than quicc-and-go.
    Most commands in this language are 1 or 2 characters.
    Here is how to code the game of 'Pong'
     l pp & p2 is co to ke
     l pp & p2 is pl
     pp & p2 go up & do bc of up & do ar ke
     l bl is mo ac sc ba & fo
     if bl go of sc gv pt to o pl
     if bl ht tp or bm sc is ok
    Wow that's extremely short code AND it's readable!

 • MooMoo123
    An extremely generalized programming language only readable by Bovine.
    Discovered by The Great Bovine.
    Here is how to code the game of 'Catch the Cow'
     moo moooo oo mo mo omomom moo
     MM ooOo ommM    omomo omo Oommmmm
     mmmmmmm
    Wow that's also extremely short code AND it's readable!


 • iiiLang
    A smart computer language discovered a while back.
    It's surprising similarities with the iii language is remarkable.
    Only those who have IMpromptU3 can code in this language
    Undiscovered by most peoples.


As of the current age, over 1000 programming languages have been discovered, but only 10 are commonly used.
The reason for this is that most programming languages, once discovered, are kept secret, because they are so valuable.

The species of Pro__WEFOLOW-1 only speaks in the iiiLang. -1 greatly appreciates this //
Pro__WEFOLOW-1 are actually computers themselves, but this is a touchy and controversial subject for them.


 A Common Computer
        or
  Pro__WEFOLOW-1
      ______
     |______|
     || ._.|| <(ii:i II;;; iii+ii)
     ||____||
     |______|
    ___|__|___
   /__________\
   |__________|

You can learn more about COMPUTERS in a different Chapter.
Later, professionals figured out how to speak to computers easier.

Running the following code in elBasic triggers The Awakening
 elPoke("AWAKE YONDER -1")

However, only 1% of computers can handle The Awakening, so choose wisely.
The Awakening is not completely understood, but only to The Immortal or those with 37332 XP
