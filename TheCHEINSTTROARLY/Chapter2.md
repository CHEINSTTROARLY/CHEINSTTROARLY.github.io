Prophecy 1
Believed to be about man's discovery of counting

One day, mortals will find out that they can have more than one of things.
Since mortals like things, they will want a way to see who has the most things.
So they can steal their things, and get more things for themselves.
Mortals will devise a way of adding things to other things, to get a list of things.
This list of things will become different, and soon all lists of things will be the same, varying only for how many things are on the list of things

After learning to count things, mortals wanted to have more things, so they counted other mortals’ things and decided to steal them.
Soon, everyone’s things were being stolen, even stolen things were being stolen.
The best thieves with the best hiding spots got the most things.

-1 will create a storm to strike them down.

Prophecy 14
Believed to be the beginning of humans

After the other mortals of interest all accidentally killed themselves in honor of panda bears, -1 worked with Petrichor to create a new kind of mortals on a small part of him known as Earth. These are the Fourteenth of Petrichor’s sacred peoples, and the last mortals to be created by him, though -1 did most of the work. These mortals were created near the location of the greatest of the Fourteen Sacred Temples of Petrichor, of which the closest any ever get together is on Earth, where there are three. Around the greatest one, they built a city, protected from harm by the power of the Sacred Temple. This city would later become known as Nindy’s Place. The original name was forgotten, since the Great Evil of the Second Age will cause it to have similar protections to the main structure at the top of the Sacred Temples of Petrichor, so that saying it would cause the end of the mortal who tries.

Around the greatest of Petrichor’s Sacred Temples was Nindy’s Place. The humans lived there for an Er, before many decided to leave. Eventually Nindy’s Place would be hidden among the Earth through various means. The majority of it shall be hidden near the Grandest of the Fourteen Sacred Temples of Petrichor.
