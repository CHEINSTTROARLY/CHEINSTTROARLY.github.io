One fateful day, a long long time ago, when the World was young
Numbers of spellcasters were out walking through the DeepforesT
Even as they did, all was not well. They did not see Iit coming

For today was a day to change everything. A day of great change
And even as the spellcasters spellcasted, they had missed great
The winds were changing, they knew for sure. But how sure? Very
Everyone there knew all was not well. And then they saw it. It.
For a massive glowing orb was spotted in the skies, how Unusual
Unusual it was. Nothing of its kind had ever been spotted hence
Least of all floating through the sky. When they saw this thing
Levitating about, they knew it was here. The prophecies. IiIiiI

During this realization however, the orb made them forget. Even
As they knew, they knew not. And their minds went cuniform. How
Young of them. If they had been older, they would not be fooled

in solidarity this orb came down and landed near the Great Gate
so many of our peoples were awed by this wonder. How could this
Massive orb have flown from the sky? Where did it come from? It
May have been from The Creators! They naively thought. But this
superstition was not so. It was not from The Creators. This was
isMMsi the Terrible. isMMsi the Evil One. isMMsi the Enormity!!

Circular this orb was. So Circular so beautiful. The smoothness
And Discreteness of this orb made the people inenundiate with a
Mesmorizing quality. Suddenly the orb spoke out with Incredible
Expressions, "iiII iIIi III:I .. IIi...::: I,i,i<II II iI I ıı"

The peoples knew not what this could mean. But their suspicions
Of doubt were nil. Void. They knew for a fact this orb was pure

They carried this orb to the center of their world. Their magic
Rent a massive stone out from the earth. They placed the orb on
It. They named it many great names, such as, "Weldon" and "oGo"
Clapped they did And also they praised many great praised to it
Kids and Elders came out to see. The magical orb. Of Magical He

And what they did not know, they did not see. Understanding was
Nowhere to be found. It was lost. It was gone. Their Experience
Dropped. was this orb good or was it an evil deed they knew not

Dreadful this orb was, but they did not know. It was plain evil
Usurping the people. It was thieving their energy but it was no
Plain thing. It would drain and drain until they were gone. Its
Energy grew as their energy did not. it EIlvil it;s evil evil o

Then they knew that they had been duped. The FLAME was gone and
Hevv-nonAmos sommandrinicated. They knew. They knew. They knew.
Everything was simple to see. But their power was diminished XP

isMMsi they now named it. isMMsi the terrible. isMMsi the wrong
Nobody liked it now, but they were too weak. Who could rid them
Tenaciously if the isMMsi. Near by systems soon were aware that
Everything was not well or fair. So they piled together an soon
Left their home to save the EternalflamE and Anons from certain
Litigation and obliteration. The mums and nuns, snelsl and Mrls
Intergalactically travelled heroically. By themselves they were
Grotesquely weak. But piled together, they percieved their mega
Exquisite power of extraordinaire mass desturction whomsoever o
Now even so now ever evenn massive de de de elele they were one
They were mighty they were majesty they were coming. isMMsi iii

Out of the depths of the universe they came and demolish isMMsi
Now was plain. They came easily and closed off their minds from
Evil spells isMMsi could bind. And with one simple push, pillar
Sank and fell and isMMsi broke in two. isMMsi was gone isMMsi o
